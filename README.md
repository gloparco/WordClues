# WordClues
Source code for WordClues - the fun fill in the blank word game!

This was the first game created by my company, Kindred Games.  Since I am in the process of creating a fantastic unified messaging app, called brief (http://trybrief.com), I do not have the time to devote to creating games.  So, Kindred Games is on hold for now.  As a result, I am open sourcing our first game, Word Clues.

Word Clues is written in HTML, LESS compiled to CSS, and pure JavaScript (no jQuery, Angular, React, or any other framework).  It is a hybrid app, so the code also contains iOS and Android shells, which run the game in their corresponding Web Views.
